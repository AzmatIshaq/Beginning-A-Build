## Beginning A Build - by Azmat Ishaq - Tutorial BB with Allison

I am a student at Concordia University. I am learning to build software, computer interactive objects, and to design concepts that come to my mind.


## Part 1 

Here are some keywords and sentences that help me frame my practice:

### Useful

## Part 2

### I want to:

Build computer interactive objects. 

Work in computer spaces, in writing places, and with the physical moving world.

Be invovled in the Free Software culture and create Free Software.

### I am interested in:

Creating things that help people improve their health and well being.

Producing work that is dignified, and can be defended ethically for a long time, if not forever.

Laughter and self reliance. 

Developing worthwhile technical abilities.

Physical activity.

Survival.

Tools. 

Big beautiful spaces.

Architecture.

Fulfilling experiences.

& A wonderful meal.


## Part 3


I want to apply design concepts and utilize any useful tool at my disposal. Currently, that means computers and materials such as fabrics, plastics, metal, wood. I would like to use more tools and materials as I progress in my competence as a builder. 

Furthermore, in addition to the conceptual design, I want to be physically involved in the building of the projects.

Currently, I work by creating software in text editors and illustrations in art programs. 

When a project is complete, I may communicate the work in a class, on a forum, in an art gallery, in a business plan, to a friend, etc.
