## Beginning A Build - by Azmat Ishaq - Tutorial BB with Allison

I am a student at Concordia University. I am learning to build software, computer interactive objects, and to design concepts that come to my mind.


## Part 1 

Here are some keywords and sentences that help me frame my practice:

### Useful

Has functional value.  

### Graceful

Invokes a sense of quality and elegance.  

</br>
</br>

Dignified.

Righteous.

</br>

Ethics.

Timing.

</br>

Beauty.

Nature.


## Part 2

### I want to:

Build computer interactive objects. 

Work in computer spaces, in writing places, and with the physical moving world.

Participate in the Free Software culture and create Free Software.

### I am interested in:

Creating things that help people improve their health and well being.

Producing work that is dignified, and can be defended ethically for a long time, if not forever.

Laughter and self reliance. 

Developing worthwhile technical abilities.

Physical activity.

Survival.

Tools. 

Big beautiful spaces.

Architecture.

Fulfilling experiences.

& A wonderful meal.


## Part 3

I also want to be physically involved in the building stage of conceptualized projects.

I want to apply design concepts physically by utilizing any useful tool at my disposal. Currently, I work mainly by creating software in text editors and illustrating art in computer programs. However, I would like to use additional physical tools and materials — fabrics, plastics, metal, wood, and more — while I progress in my competence as a builder. 

When a project is complete, I may communicate the work in a class, on a website or forum, in an art gallery, in a business plan, to a friend, etc.

See you after (or during) the build!
