## Let's Design Experience - by Azmat Ishaq - Tutorial BB with Allison Peacock

I am a computer artist who enjoys **building** interactive programs and experiences. Ultimately, I **create** and **design** concepts that come to my mind. Recently I've been interested in designing experiences that leverage computers as a tool for educating people in ways that are engaging.

## Values 

My practice is based on aspiring to a certain set of values. If my work can provide value to people then I think it is worth pursuing.

### Useful

Has functional value.  

### Graceful

Has inspirational and aesthetic value 

</br>

Some words that **guide my practice**:

</br>

Dignified,    Ethics,    Nature

Righteous,    Timing,    Beauty

</br>

## Community

Community can shake people out of individualized focus and shows us the value of shared experiences.

### Technical

Community interaction is not just good for the mind but it can help artists develop personal and technical skills.

## Goals

I would like to engage with the Free Software culture and create Free Software.  

Hopefully there can be collaboration to create software which encourage people to experience long term well-being through movement. If technology can make people sedentary then perhaps it can make people functionally active as well.

This may involve creating works that involve movement from the artists as well. Instead of computer artists mainly working in front of screens, perhaps we can begin working with communities and materials. Let's make computer art a physical experience.

## Contact

When a project is complete, I may communicate the work in a class, on a website or forum, in an art gallery, in a business plan, to a friend, etc.
